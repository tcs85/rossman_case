# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project involves predicting daily sales for Rossmann stores using historical sales data. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts sales based on various features such as store information, promotional activities, and historical sales data.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes sales data for various Rossmann stores. It contains several features such as store type, location, competition distance, promotional activities, and holiday information, among others. The target variable is the sales amount.

## Methodology
The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and trends.
3. **Modeling**: Training various machine learning models to predict sales.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.

## Results
The models were evaluated based on their performance on the test dataset. The final model was selected based on its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to predict retail sales. The results show that machine learning models can effectively forecast sales based on historical data and additional features.

## Future Work
Further improvements could involve more sophisticated feature engineering, the inclusion of external data sources, and the application of advanced models such as deep learning.
